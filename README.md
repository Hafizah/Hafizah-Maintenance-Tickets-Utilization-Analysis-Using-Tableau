# Maintenance Codes Utilization


Business Problem:
During the performance evaluation process, the client noticed that a few of their worst
performing field technicians have made remarkable improvements in their Repeat
measurement. A field technician receives a Repeat when he completes a service order and the
customer’s issue is not resolved, thus resulting in a second service order within 30 days to the
same customer. The client suspects that technicians are purposefully utilizing maintenance
codes, which are filtered for Repeats, to close their work orders, thus shielding themselves from
Repeats. Through your investigation, you discover that technicians, if they are following the
correct process, must create an escalation work order for the maintenance organization. If they
do not create the maintenance ticket, they are not following the process, thus it is fair to
assume that they are intentionally manipulating their performance scores.
The client uses a system of points as a measure of time on job. The time on job is calculated as
completion time – arrival time and one point is equal to five minutes.

The Ask: 
Provide a Tableau dashboard including the following:
A line graph of the total number of work orders by week
A histogram of the Time on Job of all work orders measured in points. 
What is average time on job?

Identify the technicians that utilized the maintenance code when completing
the work order but did not create an escalation ticket. Summarize the top 10
technicians with the most missing escalation tickets
Provide any additional visuals or statistics based on the data
Create a brief summary document including:

A written description of the methodology you used in order to complete the
analysis

A description of your findings. The section should include your tables, charts,
and any additional summary statistics.

Recommendations: Please provide a summary of your recommendations. 
For example, how would you improve the tech escalation process in order to ensure
compliance? 
How would you encourage technicians to adhere to your new process? 

What would you recommend that the client do in order to address the
technicians that were identified to be the worst followers of the current
process?
